# Tmux Install
Installs the Latest or noted versions of Tmux, ncurse, libevent in a users homedirectory or system based install.  No root required.  Great for having tmux anywhere you don't have root, school, work (with permission).

Repo's are usually way out of date, and I want to enjoy the Tmux goodness sooner.

basic parse using curl/wget of github and projects homepages to find latest stable versions.


Primary OS's I have tested with...

  -Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  
  -Linux Mint

  -RedHat 7/8
  
  -Centos 7/8

  -raspbian (Buster/Strech)
  
-Requirements
  openssl package ( Not required by my script, but required by tmux build process )
  
  
run install_tmux.sh as a basic user to install to your local home directory.
  
or
  
run as root to have the option to install system wide.
  
  
**Also use at your own risk.  Meaning read through it and test it on a VM before installation.
